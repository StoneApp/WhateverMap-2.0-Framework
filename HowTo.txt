How To Use WhateverMap Framework
================================

1) add Whatevermap_Framework.xproj to your project

2) Project Settings - add path to header files to "Header Search Path"

3) Build Phases
   - add WhateverMap library to Target Dependencies
   - add WhateverMap library, CFNEtwork, CoreLocation, QuartzCore, SystemConfiguration to Link Binary With Libraries

4) Import files to your project
   - #import "WMMapView.h"
   - #import "WMDataSource.h"
   
5) Use WhateverMap Framework
   - init your own WMMapView object with frame and add it to your view   
   - set MapDelegate
   - set WMDataSource (you can use default constructor "initWithDefaultDefinition" with sample initialization)

//warning sometimes may not be possible to generate .ipa 


If you are experiencing problems with building the source code and receiving something as lWhateverMap_Framework missing as linker error. Try to watch your libWhateverMap_Framework.a in project. If it is marked as missing (red color) try to go into project WhateverMap_2 / target WhateverMap_2 / Build Phases / Link Binary With Libraries and then remove and add libWhateverMap_Framework.a. Than Try to build the project again.
