WhateverMap 2.0

This source code was developed on Department of Geoinformation Technology at the Mendel University in Brno as A part of Ph. D. Thesis by Jiří Kamínek and supervised by Stanislav Šumbera from Intergraph.
  The purpose of this code development is to create a prototype of universal mobile  GIS application dealing with different kinds of geospatial sources available today.
  The project is easy upgradable to iPad or universal one. 
  As a prototype there are some temporary solution that need to be fixed in the future or completely rewritten.

If you plan to use the code please let us know and include a link or any other connection to this project.
